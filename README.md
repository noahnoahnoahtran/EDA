# üß™ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects

This repository contains a collection of EDA projects I worked on during my data analysis learning journey.  
Each project explores a different dataset and focuses on uncovering insights through visualization and descriptive statistics.

> ‚ùóMost projects in this repository are based on publicly available datasets and Kaggle notebooks.  
> I have credited the original sources accordingly and made modifications wherever needed to improve clarity or accuracy.
